This is my first mini game written in C++ and SFML.
This is configured in Xcode only, and can be played with keyboard inputs like WASD keys and clicking on screen.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW TO PLAY
In order to win, shoot every GM (robot-like-sprites) before they touch the player (you) by clicking on the screen to launch bullets.
You can move through space using WASD keys.

At the end of the game, the total elapsed time will show. Press B if you want to restart

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ASSETS SOURCES
  - Sound assets are from Mobile Suit Gundam osts and soundeffects.
  - Player sprite is Keroro in png
  - Enemy "robots" are RGM 78 GM from Mobile Suit Gundam
