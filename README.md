This is my first mini game written in C++ and SFML
It is configured in Xcode only, and can be played with keyboard inputs like WASD keys and clicking on screen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to win, shoot every GM (robot-like-sprites) before they touch the player (you) by clicking on the screen to launch bullets.
You can move through space using WASD keys only. 

At the end of the game, the total elapsed time will show. Press B if you want to restart
